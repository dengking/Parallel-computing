Abstract—This paper compares two patterns of concurrency: the **Actor Model** and the **Active Object Model**. 

The Actor Model is a pattern that decouples function invocation from execution and offers both inherent thread-safety and scalability. 

The Active Object Model inherits from the Actor Model and as such presents the same major properties. 

As the Active Object Model inherits from the Actor Model one may think they are equivalent. Throughout this paper we show that both patterns differ in terms of structure design and communication protocols. These differences affect the choice of pattern for specific applications as each pattern has strengths and weaknesses.
