# Stream model



## wikipedia [Stream processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing)

**[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media) processing** is a [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) paradigm, equivalent to [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming), [event stream processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_stream_processing), and [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing#cite_note-1) that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of [parallel processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing). Such applications can use multiple computational units, such as the [floating point unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_unit) on a [graphics processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) or [field-programmable gate arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (FPGAs),[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing#cite_note-2) without explicitly managing allocation, synchronization, or communication among those units.
