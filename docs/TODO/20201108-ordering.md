# Ordering in distributed system

在阅读TensorFlow whitepaper的时候，其中有这样的描述:

> Our implementation also sometimes inserts **control dependencies** to enforce **orderings** between otherwise independent operations as a way of, for example, controlling the peak memory usage.

这让我想到了之前在阅读zookeeper Overview的时候，其中也有很多关于ordering的描述:

> The ZooKeeper implementation puts a premium on high performance, highly available, strictly **ordered** access. 



> The strict **ordering** means that sophisticated synchronization primitives can be implemented at the client.



> **ZooKeeper is ordered.** ZooKeeper stamps each update with a number that reflects the order of all ZooKeeper transactions. Subsequent operations can use the order to implement higher-level abstractions, such as synchronization primitives.

非常类似MVCC的思想。



> Sequential Consistency - Updates from a client will be applied in the order that they were sent.



显然，在distributed system中，ordering是一个非常重要的主题。

检索 "ordering in distributed system"，最先弹出的往往是: Lamport clock，这部分内容放到了`Distributed-computing\Ordering`章节中。
