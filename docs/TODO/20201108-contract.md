## C++ Memory Model

In the first approach, the C++ memory model defines a contract. This contract is established between the programmer and the system. The system consists of the compiler, which compiles the program into assembler instructions, the processor, which performs the assembler instructions and the different caches, which stores the state of the program. The contract requires from the programmer to obey certain rules and gives the system the full power to optimise the program as far as no rules are broken. The result is - in the good case - a well-defined program, that is maximal optimised. Precisely spoken, there is not only a single contract, but a fine-grained set of contracts. Or to say it differently. The weaker the rules are the programmer has to follow, the more potential is there for the system to generate a highly optimised executable.
