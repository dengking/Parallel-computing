# [Distributed cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache)

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a **distributed cache** is an extension of the traditional concept of [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) used in a single [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_hardware)). A distributed cache may span multiple servers so that it can grow in size and in transactional capacity. It is mainly used to store application data residing in [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) and web [session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)) data. The idea of distributed caching[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache#cite_note-1) has become feasible now because [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) has become very cheap and [network cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller) have become very fast, with 1 Gbit now standard everywhere and 10 Gbit gaining traction. Also, a distributed cache works well on lower cost machines usually employed for [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) as opposed to [database servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_server) which require expensive hardware.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache#cite_note-2) An emerging internet architecture known as [Information-centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking) (ICN) is one of the best examples of a distributed cache network. The ICN is a network level solution hence the existing distributed network cache management schemes are not well suited for ICN.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache#cite_note-3) In the [supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) environment, distributed cache is typically implemented in the form of [burst buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burst_buffer).
