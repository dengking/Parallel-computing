# Rendezvous 

在[ZooKeeper Programmer's Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes)中提及了rendezvous ，回想起之前遇到过的rendezvous hash，觉得有必要对rendezvous进行总结。



## wikipedia [Rendezvous protocol](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_protocol)

A **rendezvous protocol** is a [computer network protocol](https://infogalactic.com/info/Protocol_(computing)) that enables resources or [P2P](https://infogalactic.com/info/Peer-to-peer) network peers to find each other.

## Rendezvous problem

### infogalactic [Rendezvous problem](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem)

The **rendezvous dilemma** can be formulated in this way:



If they both choose to wait, of course, they will never meet. If they both choose to walk there are chances that they meet and chances that they do not. If one chooses to wait and the other chooses to walk, then there is a theoretical certainty that they will meet eventually; in practice, though, it may take too long for it to be guaranteed. The question posed, then, is: what strategies should they choose to maximize their probability of meeting?

Examples of this class of problems are known as **rendezvous problems**. These problems were first introduced informally by [Steve Alpern](https://infogalactic.com/info/Steve_Alpern) in 1976,[[1\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-1) and he formalised the continuous version of the problem in 1995.[[2\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-2) This has led to much recent research in rendezvous search.[[3\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-3) Even the symmetric rendezvous problem played in *n* discrete locations (sometimes called the *Mozart Cafe Rendezvous Problem*)[[4\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-4) has turned out to be very difficult to solve, and in 1990 [Richard Weber](https://infogalactic.com/info/Richard_Weber_(mathematician)) and Eddie Anderson conjectured the optimal strategy.[[5\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-5) Only recently has the conjecture been proved for *n* = 3 by [Richard Weber](https://infogalactic.com/info/Richard_Weber_(mathematician)).[[6\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Rendezvous_problem#cite_note-6) This was the first non-trivial symmetric rendezvous search problem to be fully solved.

As well as being problems of theoretical interest, rendezvous problems include real-world problems with applications in the fields of [synchronization](https://infogalactic.com/info/Synchronization), [operating system](https://infogalactic.com/info/Operating_system) design, [operations research](https://infogalactic.com/info/Operations_research), and even [search and rescue](https://infogalactic.com/info/Search_and_rescue) operations planning.
