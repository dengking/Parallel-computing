# [The Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)

### What is Raft?

Raft is a **consensus algorithm** that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are available today.

### Hold onâ€”what is consensus?

Consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make progress when any **majority** of their servers is available; for example, a cluster of 5 servers can continue to operate even if 2 servers fail. If more servers fail, they stop making progress (but will never return an incorrect result).

Consensus typically arises in the context of **replicated state machines**, a general approach to building fault-tolerant systems. Each server has a **state machine** and **a log**. The **state machine** is the component that we want to make **fault-tolerant**, such as a hash table. It will appear to clients that they are interacting with a single, reliable state machine, even if a minority of the servers in the cluster fail. Each **state machine** takes as input commands from its **log**. In our **hash table** example, the log would include commands like *set x to 3*. A **consensus algorithm** is used to agree on the commands in the servers' logs. The **consensus algorithm** must ensure that if any **state machine** applies *set x to 3* as the *n*th command, no other **state machine** will ever apply a different *n*th command. As a result, each **state machine** processes the same series of commands and thus produces the same series of results and arrives at the same series of states.

***SUMMARY*** : 

### Raft Visualization

Here's a Raft cluster running in your browser. You can interact with it to see Raft in action. Five servers are shown on the left, and their logs are shown on the right. We hope to create a screencast soon to explain what's going on. This visualization ([RaftScope](https://github.com/ongardie/raftscope)) is still pretty rough around the edges; pull requests would be very welcome.

[The Secret Lives of Data](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) is a different visualization of Raft. It's more guided and less interactive, so it may be a gentler starting point.

### Publications

This is "the Raft paper", which describes Raft in detail: [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) by [Diego Ongaro](https://twitter.com/ongardie) and [John Ousterhout](http://www.stanford.edu/~ouster/). A slightly shorter version of this paper received a Best Paper Award at the [2014 USENIX Annual Technical Conference](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions/presentation/ongaro).

Diego Ongaro's [Ph.D. dissertation](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation#readme) expands on the content of the paper in much more detail, and it includes a simpler cluster membership change algorithm.
