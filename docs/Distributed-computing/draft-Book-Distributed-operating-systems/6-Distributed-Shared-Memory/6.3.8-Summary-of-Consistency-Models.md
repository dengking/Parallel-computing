# [6.3.8. Summary of Consistency Models](https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/143358/224/Tanenbaum_-_Distributed_operating_systems.html)

Although other **consistency models** have been proposed, the main ones are discussed above. They differ in how **restrictive** they are, how complex their implementations are, their ease of programming, and their performance. **Strict consistency** is the most **restrictive**, but because its implementation in a DSM system is essentially impossible, it is never used.  

**Sequential consistency** is feasible, popular with programmers, and widely used. It has the problem of **poor performance**, however. The way to get around this result is to relax the **consistency model**. Some of the possibilities are shown in Fig. 6-24(a), roughly in order of decreasing restrictiveness.  

| Consistency | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strict      | Absolute **time ordering** of all **shared accesses** matters |
| Sequential  | All processes see all **shared accesses** in the same order  |
| Causal      | All processes see all casually-related **shared accesses** in the same order |
| Processor   | PRAM consistency + memory coherence                          |
| PRAM        | All processes see writes from each processor in the order they were issued. Writes from different processors may not always be seen in the same order |

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Weak    | **Shared data** can only be counted on to be consistent after a **synchronization** is done |
| Release | **Shared data** are made consistent when a **critical region** is exited |
| Entry   | **Shared data** pertaining to a critical region are made consistent when a **critical region** is entered |
