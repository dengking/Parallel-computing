# Busy waiting





## wikipedia [Busy waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), **busy-waiting**, **busy-looping** or **spinning** is a technique in which a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) repeatedly checks to see if a condition is true, such as whether [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard) input or a [lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)) is available. Spinning can also be used to generate an arbitrary time delay, a technique that was necessary on systems that lacked a method of waiting a specific length of time. Processor speeds vary greatly from computer to computer, especially as some processors are designed to dynamically adjust speed based on current workload[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting#cite_note-1).
