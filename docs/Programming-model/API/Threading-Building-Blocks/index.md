## wikipedia [Threading Building Blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threading_Building_Blocks)

**Threading Building Blocks** (**TBB**) is a [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) [template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)) [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)) developed by [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) for [parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming) on [multi-core processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor). Using TBB, a computation is broken down into [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_parallelism) that can run in parallel. The library manages and [schedules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) [threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) to execute these tasks.
