# [Fan-out (software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software))

In [message-oriented middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-oriented_middleware) solutions, **fan-out** is a [messaging pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern) used to model an information exchange that implies the delivery (or spreading) of a [message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message) to one or multiple [destinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) possibly in parallel, and not halting the process that executes the messaging to wait for any response to that message.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)#cite_note-3)

Also fan-out in [software construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_construction) means the number of classes used by a certain class or the number of methods called by a certain method.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)#cite_note-4)
