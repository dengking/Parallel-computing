# Concurrency control

Concurrency control无处不在。

## wikipedia [Concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control)





Concurrency control can require significant additional complexity and overhead in a [concurrent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_algorithm) compared to the simpler [sequential algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_algorithm).

> NOTE: concurrent algorithm VS sequential algorithm
