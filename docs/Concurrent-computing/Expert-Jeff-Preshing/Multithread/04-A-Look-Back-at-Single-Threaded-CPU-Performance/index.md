# [A Look Back at Single-Threaded CPU Performance](https://preshing.com/20120208/a-look-back-at-single-threaded-cpu-performance/)

> NOTE: 促使我收录这篇文章的原因是: 它对multicore parallel computing发展趋势的总结，在工程hardware的 `CPU\Parallel-computing` 章节中讨论了这个主题。

Perhaps the turning point came in May 2004, when Intel [canceled its latest single-core development effort](http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4048847/Intel-cancels-Tejas-moves-to-dual-core-designs) to focus on multicore designs. Later that year, Herb Sutter wrote his now-famous article, [The Free Lunch Is Over](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm). Not all software will run remarkably faster year-over-year anymore, he warned us. Concurrent software would continue its meteoric(极速的) rise, but single-threaded software was about to get left in the dust.
