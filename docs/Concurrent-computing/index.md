# Concurrent computing

“concurrent computing”即并发，一个我们平时经常听到的词语。在谈及concurrency的时候，我们要思考：

1、并发的entity/unit是什么？



## wikipedia [Concurrent computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing#Concurrent_programming_languages)

**Concurrent computing** is a form of [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) in which several [computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) are executed *[concurrently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science))*—during overlapping time periods—instead of *sequentially*, with one completing before the next starts.



## Summary

在 wikipedia [Concurrent computing#Coordinating access to shared resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing#Coordinating_access_to_shared_resources) 中说明了: 为什么在concurrent computing中需要concurrency control:

> The main challenge in designing concurrent programs is [concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control): ensuring the correct sequencing of the interactions or communications between different computational executions, and coordinating access to resources that are shared among executions.
