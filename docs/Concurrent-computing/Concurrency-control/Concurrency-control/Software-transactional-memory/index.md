## infogalactic [Software transactional memory](https://infogalactic.com/info/Software_transactional_memory)

In [computer science](https://infogalactic.com/info/Computer_science), **software transactional memory** (**STM**) is a [concurrency control](https://infogalactic.com/info/Concurrency_control) mechanism analogous to [database transactions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Database_transaction) for controlling access to [shared memory](https://infogalactic.com/info/Shared_memory_(interprocess_communication)) in [concurrent computing](https://infogalactic.com/info/Concurrent_computing). It is an alternative to [lock-based synchronization](https://infogalactic.com/info/Lock_(computer_science)).
