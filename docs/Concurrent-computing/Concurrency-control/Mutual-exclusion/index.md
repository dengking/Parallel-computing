# Mutual exclusion



## wikipedia [Mutual exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **mutual exclusion** is a property of [concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control), which is instituted for the purpose of preventing [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). It is the requirement that one [thread of execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) never enters its [critical section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_section) at the same time that another [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing) thread of execution enters its own critical section, which refers to an interval of time during which a thread of execution accesses a shared resource, such as [shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory_(interprocess_communication)).
