> Wait-free algorithms were rare until 2011, both in research and in practice. However, in 2011 Kogan and [Petrank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erez_Petrank)[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#cite_note-wf-queue-17) presented a wait-free queue building on the [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap) primitive, generally available on common hardware. Their construction expanded the lock-free queue of Michael and Scott,[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#cite_note-lf-queue-18) which is an efficient queue often used in practice.
